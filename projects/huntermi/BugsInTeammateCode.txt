Bug Name: Smithy +3 cards failure
Assigned to: Travis Nykaza
Reported by: Michael Hunter
Reported: May 27, 2017
Severity: Low
Priority: Medium
Status: Unresolved

Description: playing the smithy card fails to give that player 3 cards.

Symptoms: After playing the card, I end up with one card added to 
	my hand instead of three. Causes function to fail card test
	(see unittestresults.out).

Reproduction: enter the following commands
	make dominion.o (if not compiled)
	make player     (if not compiled)
	player 1
	init 2 1
	add 14
	show
	play 5
	show

Possible cause: calling the drawCard function too few times.
	



Bug Name: Adventurer Segmentation Fault
Assigned to: Travis Nykaza
Reported by: Michael Hunter
Reported: May 27, 2017
Severity: High
Priority: High
Status: Unresolved

Description: Adventurer occasionally causes a segmentation fault 
	under valid preconditions.

Symptoms: After playing the card in a game of dominion, the 
	program crashes, exiting with a segmentation fault.

Reproduction: enter the following commands
	make dominion.o (if not compiled)
	make player     (if not compiled)
	player 1
	init 2 1
	add 7
	show
	play 5
	show

Possible cause: running the test in gdb I found
	that it fails on line 33:
   cardDrawn = state->hand[cardDrawn][state->handCount[currentPlayer] - 1];
